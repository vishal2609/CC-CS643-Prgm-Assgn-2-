# Wine Quality Prediction - Cloud Computing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a **Wine Quality Prediction** machine learning model using **Apache Spark** on **AWS EMR** with **4 EC2 instances** for training and **1 EC2 instance** for prediction. It was implemented in **Java** and integrated with **S3 storage**.

---

## Project Phases Completed

- âœ… Created EMR Cluster (4 nodes: 1 master + 3 core nodes).
- âœ… Launched cluster with Hadoop and Spark applications.
- âœ… Connected via SSH (PuTTY on Windows).
- âœ… Uploaded `TrainingDataset.csv` and `ValidationDataset.csv` to S3 bucket.
- âœ… Set up Java project with Maven.
- âœ… Built training application: `WinePrediction.java`.
- âœ… Built prediction application: `WinePredictApp.java`.
- âœ… Trained Logistic Regression model with MLlib.
- âœ… Saved and loaded model from S3.
- âœ… Performed mini model tests.
- âœ… Evaluated model performance using F1 Score.
- âœ… Successfully ran applications using `spark-submit` on EMR.

## Notes
- For screenshots of YARN UI and Spark jobs, use Windows Snipping Tool or built-in screenshot shortcuts.
- All logs were verified using Spark History Server and YARN Resource Manager.

---

## Next Steps
- Dockerize the Wine Prediction App.
- Test containerized app on a single EC2 instance.
